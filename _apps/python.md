- title: Operators
  fields:
     - field: If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	
       value: (a == b) is not true.
     - field: If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
       value: (a != b) is true.
     - field: If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
       value: (a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator.
     - field: If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
       value: (a > b) is not true.
     - field: If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
       value: (a < b) is true.
     - field: If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
       value: (a >= b) is not true.
     - field: If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
       value: (a <= b) is true.
